This is a project in Python where the objective was to print random, specific, or all stocks within each stock family. 

Here is the official description and instructions for the project that was given from the instructor:

  -Main Menu Item 1:  DJIA

-The application shall accept user input of stock symbols consisting of exactly three (3), four (4), or five (5) alphabet characters

-The application shall accept user input of either all uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed-case (combination of uppercase and lowercase) symbols

-Once a main menu and sub-menu selection are made, the application shall output the stock symbol, new price, actual change, % change, and old price 

-All output to the Sense Hat emulator shall scroll left and right

    -If the change is positive, the actual change shall be preceded by a  plus sign (+) 
  
    -If the change is negative, the actual change shall be preceded by a negative sign (-)
    
    -If there has been no change, the actual change shall not be preceded by a symbol
    
    -The actual change symbol shall be followed by the actual change value:
  
  -The % change shall be preceded by exactly one (1) of the following symbols:
  
    -If the change is positive, the % change shall be preceded by a plus sign (+)
    
    -If the change is negative, the % change shall be preceded by a minus sign (-)
